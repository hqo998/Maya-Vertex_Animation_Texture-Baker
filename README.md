# Maya - Vertex Animation Texture Baker

A Maya tool to bake animations from Maya into a texture to use in Game Engines.




## FAQ

#### Installation
Intall script files to Maya Scripts folder
```
*\Documents\maya\2023\scripts\VertexAnimationTexture\VertexAnimationGUI.py
*\Documents\maya\2023\scripts\VertexAnimationTexture\VertexAnimationCapture.py
*\Documents\maya\2023\scripts\VertexAnimationTexture\spliceimage.py
*\Documents\maya\2023\scripts\VertexAnimationTexture\__init__.py
```
Add Maya button to shelf
```
from VertexAnimationTexture import VertexAnimationGUI
from importlib import reload
reload(VertexAnimationGUI)


start = VertexAnimationGUI.VATUI()
start.show()
```
Install Qt.py wrapper to Maya Scripts

#### Using the premade UE materials
- Add the VAT folder inside of the content folder in your Unreal Project
- Make an instance of the MM_demo_MayaToUnreal_VAT material and import your texture maps.
- Make sure textures have SRGB turned off!!!
- Ensure scale setting is the same as used to bake in Maya.
- Make any changes you need.

#### How to use?
- Select a mesh
- Adjust playrange on timeline for time to bake
- Press update
- Choose a output directory
- Press Start

#### Limitations
- Doesn't support hard edges - ensure all edges is shaded soft/smooth. Bevel or disconnect edges if you really need hard edges.
- Meshes above 4096 vertices are at risk of breaking and might require manual tweaking of UVs - You might be able to mitigate this be ordering the vertices in Maya
- Vertex position is based off local transforms, ensure that mesh has frozen transforms and any animations aren't directly parented to the mesh pivot. E.g Transform constraints and order heirarchy. use a full weight joint as a buffer since skinning is fine. If the mesh channel box changes values then it probably won't work.
- Joint-based animations may need the mesh to be manually exported from frame 0 via duplicating then exporting if frame 0 is not rig rest pose.
- This works off vertices, please disable nanite for this mesh.
- Split option is unreliable. Unless desperately needed please minimise the use of.

### How it works
- New UV map is created which puts all the vertices in order to line up with pixel location.
- Vertex Positions are baked in local space from the mesh pivot
- All vertex positions are relative offsets to frame 0 on the timeline
- Mesh is exported from frame 0
- Normals are baked from local space. So a normal facing up would be 0,1,0
- XYZ bakes to RGB are in Maya's coordinate space. Y-up, right-handed
- Position XYZ is baked to RGB via equation: ((XYZ/scale)+1)/2=RGB
- Scale is needed to remap position range from; e.g -89...89 to -1..1 with a scale of 89. Scale needs to be identitical 
- Normal XYZ is baked to RGB via equation: ((XYZ+1)/2)=RGB
- To use in Game Engine, you need to reverse the equation to plug into WPO
- Make sure textures are sampled linear (no SRGB)
- Pan the texture map vertically with shader to 'play' the animation in Engine.



## Issues and solutions if script doesn't work.
- Line 125 Runtime Error. This is the FBX Export code snippet, if it doesn't work then this might be due to known issues with Maya in different versions. Please use Maya 2023, use alternative tool.
- Uassets not showing up in content browser. Most likely didn't place the VAT demo folder in the correct place, folder structure should go, UEProj/content/VAT/... This issue is due to how Unreal treats Uasset files.
- Mesh is snappy / not moving properly in engine. Multiple possible solutions.
  - Lower scale in bake options as low as possible before bounds error, this allows the position texture to work with more bits.
  - Make sure your texture has SRGB turned off for position and normal.
  - Make sure mipmaps are disabled, and compression is set to UI so that the image is uncompressed.
  - In the texture filtering mode, there is bilinear and nearest, imagine nearest is stepped as smooth.
  - Check if the scale on the material instance matches the scale set in Maya during export.
  - Enable 32bit image during VAT baking process, this will enable the position data to be baked with more precision.
  - Compression setting to HDR High Precision combined with bilinear filtering can cheat a smoother look.

## Alternatives
- Try exporting as an alembic from Maya and then using Houdini's method. https://www.sidefx.com/tutorials/vertex-animation-textures-for-unreal/
